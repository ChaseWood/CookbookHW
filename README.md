# Cookbook App

Now that you've learned all about routes and controllers using JSON data, let's use a data set we're already familiar and make it dynamic! Remember the cookbook database we worked with before? We are going to use routes and controllers to add CRUD functionality, testing and interacting with our database through Postman.

## Prerequisites

* Express
* Mongoose & MongoDB
* Mongoose Queries
* Routes & Controllers
* Postman

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available to you in the main project repo. You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Requirements

1. Review the prompts that are provided to you in the following files:

* `index.js`
* `controllers/cookbooks.js`
* `controllers/authors.js`
* `db/cookbooks.json`
* `db/authors.json`

2. In the order the files are listed above, work through the prompts, adding your route/controller code block under each prompt.
3. After you have finished each prompt, use Postman to find all cookbooks in the database, and copy and paste your JSON object into the `db/cookbooks.json` file.
4. Do the same thing with your authors collection. Use Postman to find all authors in the database, and copy and paste your JSON object into the `db/authors.json` file.
3. Submit with a pull request on this repo.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Less experienced students should be able to complete the base requirements in
the alloted time for labs and in around 2 hours for homework; more experienced
students should be to complete the bonus.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.
